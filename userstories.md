## User Stories - Escape from the Ruins of the Underworld PC game

* ### 1: Game Format

 * #### 1.1 : Communicates priority and value of gameplay features
   **As a hardcore player who wants to have one of the highest scores in the world, I want a game that is relatively easy to learn and understand, so that I can easily jump in and play.**  
   *Elaboration:* Having a game with simple rules and mechanics would be ideal for beginning and intermediate players and allow everyone to enjoy the game, without requiring extensive research to understand rules and strategy.  
   *Constraints:* None  
   *Effort Estimation:* 8 person-hours  
   *Acceptance Test:* All users will have to do is click the mouse at the right times to avoid obstacles along the way; piece of cake, right? Well, no not really since the development team should speed up the image moving implementation if they want to make the game less boring and more challenging plus fun for us to play.

 * #### 1.2: Easily Accessible
   **As a user, I want a game that community members and others can play quickly if they wish to relive some kind of stress in their lives, so that we can constantly be addicted to how much this game is played around the world.**   
   *Elaboration:* Many games are not available in the PC store that are like flappy bird, becoming very rare to find to play. It is my primary goal to create a game which is freely accessed and which has players' eyes glued to the screen for only at most an hour; we do not want to make it too addicting for the audience.
   *Constraints:* None  
   *Effort Estimation:* 4 person-hours  
   *Acceptance Test:* After many user tests, a brief survey will be administered to gauge the players' feelings on the game and their experiences should show at least 50% of players had positive feelings about the new implementation behind this unique ideal game.

* ### 2: Enables designated changes and communication of these changes to the modified scope of project
 **As an experienced player of the now banned "Flappy Bird", developers should enable designated changes and communication of these changes to the modified scope of project  
 *Elaboration:* In this context, the angel who sholuld have wings should not crash to the ground whenever he does not crash into a pipe or gets hit by a fireball. Changes should be additionally made if an original idea on a specific feature of the game needs to be modified in order to fit in the overall scope of the project.
 *Constraints:* The process can take up to several hours including through tesing methods to make sure that the user requirements are minimally met or can exceed all expectations. This will require extensive playtesting.  
 *Effort Estimation:* 10 person-hours  
 *Acceptance Test:* Beta testers will be introduced to testing whether the angel avatar will stay afloat or fall due to the implemented programming mechanics 

*  ### 3: Unique details 
 **As a player, I want unique details to be added if time allows so that it is the conceptual idea of the project has its own characteristic features.**  
 *Elaboration:* Adding enemies who shoot fireballs is a classic example of something that is not in the game of Flappy Bird that the developer should plan to implement into his own game design to make it more unique and not just a "copy" of a game that was once famous and addictive.
 *Constraints:* 
 *Effort Estimation:* 4 person-hours  
 *Acceptance Test:*   Enemies should float a few feet away in front of the angel and shoot a fireball each at him so it is a little more of a challenge for players to overcome. FYI, enemies should float in front of pipes and not be harmed in any way by them.

* ### 4: Refinement of work on each functionality
 **As a player, I want to be able to be able to play the game without any flaws in the code so that the user can have a more enjoyable experience playing the game.**   
 *Elaboration:* It can be frustrating for people who have played the game flappy bird before if their avatar flies through a pipe without failing the game or if there is no audio synced to the game's UI system that can help keep the player entertained and not just bored with the potential bitter disappointment that they had wished for.
 *Constraints:* None  
 *Effort Estimation:* 9 person-hours  
 *Acceptance Test:* The user testing of each coded functionality working properly when someone plays the game, including audio, sound effects, gameplay controls, and other related mechanics.

* ### 5 : Intuitive UI
 **As a user, I want an interface that doesn't take a long time to learn, so that I can learn how to play the game more quickly.**
 * #### 5.1: Physics/Gravity Components
   **As a user, I want to be able to interact with the angel by clicking the mouse button to jump up to a higher level and not clicking anything to let the angel fall a little due to the gravity mechanic implementation in the Visual Studio IDE.**
    *Elaboration:* A user should be able to click the mouse to decide which level they will "hover" on and whenever the avatar makes contact with a pipe, then they should automatically fall to the ground and lose the game. 
    *Constraints:* A user shouldn't be able to fly endlessly through the game if they make contact with a pipe or get hit by a fireball by a flying enemy, they should automatically fall and the game will be restarted until the user exits out of the application. 
    *Effort Estimation:* 3 person-hours  
    *Acceptance Test:* Users will be able to test the game flawlessly and the implementation has the angel die/fall to the ground if either taking damage from one fireball that was shot by an enemy or had run into a "sky-level" or "ground-level" pipe. 

 * #### 5.2: Sound effect plays when player fails
   **As a user, I want a funny sound effect to play whenever the user dies during in-game play.**
   *Elaboration:* If a user hits the pipe or takes damage from fireball, the collision sound effect should play in order to create more of a humorous feature to the short list of game mechanics required by users to be implemented in the project.
   *Constraints:* Sound effect needs to be played AFTER the user crashes and burns, instead of in a random time interval at a random gameplay segment when the user is still playing the game.
   *Effort Estimation:* 1 person-hour  
   *Acceptance Test:* A collider sound effect will play during this testing of the optional functionality - rather than the original collision sound of collision from Flappy Bird - so that we may feel more disappointed whenever we fail during the gameplay. Perhaps the developer should add the collsion sound effect after the original collision to make it twice as malleable and more unique.
